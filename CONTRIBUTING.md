This integration is an addition to, and runs on top of Ramses RF

The framework will allow for easy definition of entities, cards, websockets, servicecalls, entities, hooks into ramses_rf or _cc, or whatever you come up with.
This will allow for faster development and an easy way to share your work. All without the need of special tweaks in ramses RF itself.

I would like to create it as user friendly as possible: just enable a feature and a .js card is added, with entities it requires, and also the servicecalls or websockets.
When disabling the feature, everything gets cleaned up again.

I can imagine this tool will support different cards, or other features for the same devices. A user can choose and enable only the ones he/she requires.

Feel free to create a PR or contact me if you want to contribute to this project. 
If you have a card, automation or other that you would like included, please let me know.

regards, Willem

ps. this is a work-in-progress. WIKI pages will come with info on how to contribute, requirements for PR's and examples.
