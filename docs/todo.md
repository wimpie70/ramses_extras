- more cleanup on the features, framework, starting with the hello world feature

Do we know what cards are enabled at startup ?
- removing deployed cards from local/www/ramses_extras/* when removing the entry ? or when removing a feature ?
- same for registered resources

check if we made the correct changes now....

check hvac fan card.js: around 685

todo: create json file in local/www/ramses_extras/config with the card info for card registration (without hass instance)
