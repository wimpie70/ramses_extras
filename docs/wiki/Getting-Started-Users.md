# Getting Started (Users)

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant installed and running.
- The `ramses_cc` integration installed and working (device communication).
- `ramses_extras` installed (typically via HACS or manual install).

## Enable Ramses Extras

- Add/configure the integration in Home Assistant.
- Enable the features you want (features are modular; you only enable what you use).

## Verify it is working

- Check Home Assistant logs for `ramses_extras` startup messages.
- Confirm expected entities appear for enabled features.

## Lovelace cards

Some features provide custom Lovelace cards (JavaScript). Once the integration is set up and cards are deployed/registered, you can add cards through the Lovelace UI.
