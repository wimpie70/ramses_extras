- check if we need services.py, can't we use ramses_cc directly ?

- hvac fan card editor: it never had a followup step for mapping entities (only device dropdown). good idea for future dev.

- why external calculated abs humid entities:
We may have a few temp/humid sensors for 1 fan. eg. a bathroom and a kitchen....I want to be able to create logic later that if 1 of them goes high we also should ventilate high (but then for eg 15 minutes) to get rid of the local moisture. But this would need extra logic and handshaking with automations that control the speed....
Or, we would create some kind of OR logic for the different abs humid entities -> select the highest one as the one to work with and fall back to internal after 15 minutes...or always use the highest one....The same but upside-down goes for too dry air.

- on startup, we should get the persisted  state for humidity control. or maybe better: start by setting it to off, and sending the auto command. now we can restart with the fan on high or low without knowing or control

- multi-zone support in hvac card or separate feature

- msg log analyzer: read the log (with filters) or live msg parser
- configuration analyzer ? does it exist ?
- warning card: is there a warning or error event on HA, so we could notify the cards ? This could be a 4th card, very small, but capable of filtering reoccurring warnings, warning source and show status.

- dehumidify does not work on  62%>58, 5.77 > 2.9

- extras: remove 'configure devices for features', 'available features configurations' section

- ramses_rf:
    - create PR for silent (no loggers) parsing. A wrapper or an optional parse_silent parameter
- testing env.
    - replace pre-commit hook with prek, see ramses_cc
    - deprecate: Starting in 2026.7, installation of pyserial-asyncio will be blocked in Home Assistant.

*** ramses debugger improvements ***

- traffic analyzer
    - what is the source of the traffic, can we choose between a ha logfile, ramses.log or 'live' ?
    - select all: doesn't toggle all select boxes
    - details: I don't think this adds value, we can remove this.
    - logs button: i think it's better to change this into 'copy selection' so the user can paste this in another card.
    - reset: what does it do ? it takes a while before the results field is cleared.

- messages (from traffic analyzer)
    - colors on top id's (selection)
    - list all selected messages: what is the source ? in traffic analyzer i see a total of 4 msgs, but in 'Messages' I see a lot more. This should be the same source
    - add toggle for parsed values
    - add auto hor scrollbar on Payload
    - fix dest/src/broadcast
    - make the columns sortable and default on time: earliest first

- log explorer:
    - auto hor scrollbar on tail result (without wrap we go outside the window)
    - editable before and after
    - move search options after tail result
    - horizontal line between search blocks (instead of newline)
    - bg colors on id's
    - font color: log source between [] : green

- packetexplorer:
    - the details button is out of the window scope.
    - When clicking on details, i would expect to see parsed message, but maybe use 1 toggle button to switch to parsed values instead of payload
    - In the result field, we cannot copy/past text, this would be very handy
    - the search (or filter) doesn't work, remove it ?
    - make the columns sortable and default on time: earliest first
    - instead of wrap set a auto hor. scrollbar on payload
    - bg colors on id's
    - broadcast still not working
